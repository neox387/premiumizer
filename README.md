## About premiumize.me

Premiumize.me combines anonymous cloud torrent downloads, usenet and premium hosters in one subscription. Cloud torrent downloads are cached, meaning if some other premiumize.me member downloaded the torrent through premiumize.me before, you can immediately download the files from that torrent over HTTPS at top speeds.


## How does it work?

Premiumizer will monitor download tasks on premiumize.me.
Once the download in the cloud finishes and the download task has a category that needs to be automatically downloaded premiumizer will start downloading all the files to your local computer where premiumizer is running. Download tasks without a category will not be automatically downloaded locally. Categories can be setup through the web interface's setup page.

When enabled, premiumizer can inform nzbToMedia whenever the local download is finished.

## Web Interface

By default, premiumizer's web interface listens on port 5000.
When premiumizer is running you can access it at http://localhost:5000/

## Installation using Docker

We have provide images for `amd64` & `arm64v8`. If you have a different architecture, you can build this yourself using our Dockerfile.

You need to set the correct PUID and PGID equal to the user that has rw access to the mounted volumes.

```shell
docker run \
  --name premiumizer \
  -e PUID=1000 \
  -e PGID=1000 \
  -e TZ=Europe/London \
  -p 5000:5000 \
  -v /path/to/conf:/conf \
  -v /path/to/blackhole:/blackhole \
  -v /path/to/downloads:/downloads \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  neox387/premiumizer
```

### Synology DSM

1. Create a folder using File Station where Premiumizer can store its config and logs (e.g. /volume1/docker/premiumizer)
2. Identify (or create) the locations for blackhole and downloads that Premiumizer will use
3. SSH into your syno and figure out the PUID and PGID of the user that has access to these folders
4. Open Docker app
5. Under 'Registry': Download the neox387/premiumizer image
6. Under 'Image': Select the image and click 'launch'
7. Map a port of your chosing to '5000' (e.g. Chosing 5555 to 5000, means your Premiumizer will be accessible through 5555)
8. Map your blackhole folder to '/blackhole'
9. Map your downloads folder to '/downloads'
10. Map your premiumizer conf folder to '/conf'
11. Set the following environment variables:

- PUID (see step 3.)
- PGID (see step 3.)
- TZ (e.g. Europe/London)
